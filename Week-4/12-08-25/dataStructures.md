## Non-linear Data Structures

In non-linear data structures, elements are not arranged sequentially. An element can be connected to multiple other elements, forming a hierarchical or network-like structure. This allows for more complex relationships between data elements but can make implementation and traversal more challenging.

**Examples of non-linear data structures:**

*   **Trees:** A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node is called the root, and each node can have one or more child nodes.
    ```markdown
    Tree:
    ```
    ```
          Root
         /    \
        /      \
       Node1  Node2
      / \      /
     /   \    /
    Node3 Node4 Node5
    ```
*   **Graphs:** A collection of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Unlike trees, graphs can have cycles and more complex connections between nodes.
    ```markdown
    Graph:
    ```
    ```
    NodeA --- NodeB
     |       / |
     |      /  |
     |     /   |
    NodeC --- NodeD
    ```

In summary, linear data structures arrange elements in a sequence, while non-linear data structures represent more complex relationships between elements. The choice of data structure depends on the specific problem and the relationships between the data elements.
